# Very-simple-weather-app
This app is very simple, it displays the local weather in Sydney, Australia for both today and tomorrow's forecast.

How it works:
Basically, I fetched data from the Open Weather Map API, which was in JSON format. I then accessed it using the appropriate variables, before displaying it
in the index.html file.
